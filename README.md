# AOC-ZIG - Readme

## üéÑ Project

aoc-zig is a simple template for [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) using the [zig language](https://ziglang.org/).

It's almost entirely unopinionated and does not provide any code for solving exercises. It simply removes some of the 
cruft around setting up the project so you can jump in the meat of the problems without wasting time.

The build system takes care of creating source and input files for you.

## üóíÔ∏èBasic usage

Clone or download the repository in a directory of your choice.
```
git clone https://github.com/spanzeri/aoc-zig.git
```

Enter the project directory (where build.zig) is located and start day one with:
```
zig build
```

The build command generates two new files for you (xx is the day number, from 1 to 25):
 * src/dayxx.zig: the source file for the day
 * src/data/inputxx.txt: the text file to copy your problem input into;


The source file (src/dayxx.zig) contains two stub functions for you to fill out.
```zig
pub fn solution1() {}
pub fn solution2() {}
```

If you want to start a different day, you can add -Dday to your zig build command
```
zig build -Dday=12
```

The build system remebers the last day selected, so after the intial command you can simply use: `zig build` or `zig build run`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced usage

The build system relies on two source files:
 * templates/main.zig
 * templates/day.zig

The first source file contains the entry point that is shared for every day and there shouldn't be any need to change it.

day.zig contains the template for generating a `src/dayxx.zig` file.

If you'd like to change the default template file, you can do it there (e.g. to add some shared util includes).

The template supports some simple variable substitution on generation.

Currently it supports: `${day}` which gets converted to the corresponding day number.

To add more variables, see `create_day_source_from_code` in `build.zig`.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributing

This is a very simple template and should probably remain as simple as possible.

Feel free to fork and change it to your liking.

It was also put together in a few hours while learning the language and build system.

If you spot any obvious mistake feel free to let me know.
